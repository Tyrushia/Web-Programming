            <p> My Name is Tyrael Melchizedek F. Aquiatan. I am 19 years old going 20 this December 29th.
                I am a hard-working yet lazy person. I turn on and off at times depending on the situation.
                I am half-introvert, half-extrovert also depending on the situation.
            </p>
            <p> My hobbies are to play video games that I like or find interesting. I also read manga and watcha anime
                if I feel like doing them.
                Most of the time I read manga now since I don't have much time watching anime. I also like to sing when
                I know the lyrics and I hum
                when I don't know the lyrics. I watch Vtubers for fun and because they are just interesting to watch.
                I also like to play basketball but I haven't played for so long now so I hope I get to play outside
                again especially with friends. I also love to sleep yet I sleep late haha. I also love to explore new
                things
                I don't know.
            </p>

            <p> In my spare time,I play games with friends if they are also free or I just play by myself. I also watch
                random videos I find interesting. I also watch anime or read manga in every free time I get. I also do
                household chores since my parents work and I have to help out in the house when no ones around or if
                everyone
                else is tired. </p>
            <p> I am someone who wants to help people out when they are in need or just be there for them if they feel
                lonely.
                I want what's best for everyone and see their smiles whenever I look at them. I'm still continuing to
                grow as a person
                and learn lessons about life and anything I can learn from others. I may be lazy or wrong at times but I
                try my best to
                realize those mistakes I made and learn from them and do better the next time.

            <p> My goals would be to finish school and get a job if I can right away. I also want to support
                my family and have what's best for them. I also want to go to Japan and experience what's it
                like to visit and finally see Japan for myself. I also want to lose some weight since I might
                have gained weight ever since the start of quarantine. I also dream to make a game, anime, or
                manga someday. I also dream of finding a job that I enjoy working and putting my time and effort
                on. I also want to find true happiness and say "This is what I've been waiting and praying for"
                when the time comes.
            </p>
            <p>In 30 years, I wish to continue to be happy and live my life to the fullest
                despite the struggles or problems I might face by then. I hope by 30 years I'll look by at this
                time and see how much I've grown and come to be and if I've completed some of the goals I have
                mentioned. I still have more goals but I haven't realized or put it to words right now but as of
                now I am happy living my life and continue to do my best in everything I do, one day at a time =).
            </p>
